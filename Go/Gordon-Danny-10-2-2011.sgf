;W[hp]C[I spent a lot of time attacking the upper right white group and a two point extension on the left side, and though I didn't kill anything I got a lot of forcing moves and came out ahead, despite what I think is a very poor opening (I'm sorry I couldn't remember more of it).

The final score was 46b to 29w.])
